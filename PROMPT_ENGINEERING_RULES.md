# FilaPrint Prompt Engineering Rules

## üéØ Prompt Engineering Framework

Based on [PromptingGuide.ai](https://promptingguide.ai) best practices, this document defines the prompt engineering rules and techniques for the FilaPrint project.

## üß† Core Prompt Engineering Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

```typescript
// Use CoT for complex problem solving
const cotPrompt = `
Analyze the Bambu Labs H2D MQTT connection issue step by step:

1. First, identify the connection parameters (IP, port, credentials)
2. Then, check the network connectivity and firewall settings
3. Next, validate the MQTT message format and parsing
4. Finally, implement error handling and reconnection logic

Provide your reasoning for each step.
`;
```

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting

```typescript
// Provide examples for consistent output
const fewShotPrompt = `
Example 1: Bambu Labs H2D Temperature Data
Input: {"nozzle_temp": [220, 225], "bed_temp": 60, "chamber_temp": 45}
Output: "Nozzle 1: 220¬∞C, Nozzle 2: 225¬∞C, Bed: 60¬∞C, Chamber: 45¬∞C"

Example 2: AMS2 Pro Humidity Data
Input: {"humidity": [12, 15, 18, 22], "slots": 4}
Output: "Slot 1: 12% (Good), Slot 2: 15% (Good), Slot 3: 18% (Warning), Slot 4: 22% (Critical)"

Now process this data: {"nozzle_temp": [200, 205], "bed_temp": 55, "chamber_temp": 40, "humidity": [10, 14, 16, 20]}
`;
```

### 3. Self-Consistency Prompting

```typescript
// Generate multiple solutions and choose the best
const selfConsistencyPrompt = `
Generate 3 different approaches to handle MQTT connection failures in the Bambu Labs H2D:

Approach 1: [Your first solution]
Approach 2: [Your second solution]
Approach 3: [Your third solution]

Then evaluate each approach and select the most robust solution.
`;
```

### 4. Meta Prompting

```typescript
// Use meta prompts for better AI assistance
const metaPrompt = `
You are an expert in Bambu Labs printer integration and MQTT protocols.

Your task is to help debug connection issues with the H2D printer.

When I ask about connection problems, you should:
1. Ask clarifying questions about the specific error
2. Provide step-by-step troubleshooting
3. Suggest code improvements
4. Explain the underlying MQTT protocol details

How would you approach debugging a "Connection refused" error?
`;
```

### 5. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

```typescript
// Combine reasoning with action for complex tasks
const reactPrompt = `
I need to implement live data monitoring for the Bambu Labs H2D.

Thought: I need to understand the MQTT message structure first.
Action: Search for Bambu Labs H2D MQTT documentation
Observation: Found that H2D sends JSON messages every 2 seconds

Thought: Now I need to parse the temperature data from the JSON.
Action: Create a TypeScript interface for the MQTT message structure
Observation: Defined interfaces for nozzle, bed, and chamber temperatures

Thought: I should implement error handling for connection failures.
Action: Add try-catch blocks and reconnection logic
Observation: Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection

What's the next step to complete this implementation?
`;
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security-Focused Prompting

### 1. Input Validation Prompts

```typescript
const securityPrompt = `
When processing user input for the FilaPrint application, ensure:

1. Validate all inputs using Zod schemas
2. Sanitize data to prevent XSS attacks
3. Check for SQL injection patterns
4. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
5. Log security events for monitoring

Generate secure input validation code for user registration.
`;
```

### 2. Authentication Prompts

```typescript
const authPrompt = `
Implement secure authentication for FilaPrint following OWASP guidelines:

Requirements:
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication (future)

Generate the authentication middleware code.
`;
```

## üîß Code Quality Prompts

### 1. TypeScript Best Practices

```typescript
const typescriptPrompt = `

1. Use strict mode and explicit types
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Follow naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
4. Use interfaces for data structures
5. Implement proper async/await patterns

Generate a TypeScript service class for MQTT communication.
`;
```

### 2. React Component Prompts

```typescript
const reactPrompt = `
Create a React component for displaying Bambu Labs H2D live data:

Requirements:
- Use TypeScript with proper typing
- Implement error boundaries
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Implement responsive design

`;
```

## üìä Performance Optimization Prompts
